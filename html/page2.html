				<h2>My hobbies</h2>

					</br>
					</br>
					<h3>root-me</h3>
					<img  src="../img/logo-root-me.png" alt="img root-me logo">
					<p> <strong> <a href="https://www.root-me.org/" target="_blank" > Root-me</a> </strong> is website where I can test and train my cybersecurity skill,
					it's where I first started to really learn about cybersecurity and I've instantly fallen in love with it that why it's one of my main hobbies. </p>
					
					</br> 
					</br>
					<h3>reading</h3>
					<img  src="../img/book-logo-png-13.png" alt="img book logo">
					<p><strong> Reading </strong> is my first  and principal passion, in fact it's can't be called a passion; it's an addiction : since I was 6 I never spent a day without reading. 
					At the point that I started to read in english because the translation was too slow, that's how I gained my current level in english. I mostly read Fantasy and science-fiction
					but I also like detective novel like Sherlock Holmes and even mangas and light novels...</p>
					</br>
					</br>
					</br>
					<h3>video games</h3>
					<img  src="../img/th.png" alt="img jeu video logo">
					<p>another hobby of mine  is the <strong>video games</strong> : I have a PC and a PS4 and
					I love to play to my heart content. My favourite  style of game are the opens worlds because
					I can do anything anytime and this freedom is for me the true magic of the video game. 
					</p>
				</br>
				</br>
				</br>
				<h3>artistic fencing </h3>
					<img  src="../img/escrime.jpg" alt="img jescrime ">
					<p> My most recent hobby is artistic fencing also called show fencing I started doing show fencing about two years ago and 
					had to stop this years because of my timetable but I really liked these two years; in fact I loved this so much that 
					I am now in  a fencing association and  have a pirate suit if needed !!! I even played in a short film for an artistic fencing challenge 
					you can find the video
